## Working at ORTEC

Since our founding in 1981, we have grown to employ over 1000 people at locations in Europe, the United States, Australia and Brazil. Most of our employees began working with us after completing their studies. The company’s organizational structure is flat, with short lines of communication. The atmosphere is open and informal, which forms an excellent basis for a productive working environment.

## Students and starters

We are always looking for ambitious students/starters who have affinity with IT, optimization, data science and analytics. There are different possibilities for students. As a student you can do a (graduation) internship and/or work part-time as a student assistant.
