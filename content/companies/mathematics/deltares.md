Do you want to contribute to safe and sustainable living in deltas throughout the world? Deltares gives you that opportunity. Our mission of ‘Enabling Delta Life’ is more urgent than ever due to the drastic developments such as climate change, extreme weather events and population growth. Robust knowledge based on an integrated approach is needed about water and the subsurface.

Using applied research, we develop in-depth knowledge that is necessary and useful for decision makers. By ensuring this knowledge is accessible to everyone, we help with innovative solutions. Where do we make a difference? By building on the continuity of our knowledge base. As an important knowledge partner, we help the government, companies, and society. Together, we achieve our mission: Enabling Delta Life.

We are a not-for-profit, world-leading, and mission-driven Dutch knowledge institute for water and the subsurface.
