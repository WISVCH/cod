Use the most advanced mathematics to solve the physical challenges of nanometer precision. Our
mathematicians break new ground by developing computational models of physical phenomena,
helping to optimize ASML systems. Focus on data science and machine learning to deal with huge
datasets or tackle model-based scanner control, parameter inference and more – the world of math
at ASML is vast.

ASML is changing the world, one nanometer at a time! We’re a high-tech, Netherlands-based
company manufacturing complex lithography systems that chipmakers use to produce integrated
circuits – aka microchips.

Our machines help create the electronics you use in your daily life. In the past three decades, we
have grown from a startup to a multinational company with over 60 locations globally and annual net
sales of €18.6 billion in 2021. Behind ASML’s innovation hides true talent. Our researchers,
engineers, scientists and manufacturing specialists, as well as our high-tech hardware and software
experts, make the impossible happen every day.

We invest around €2.5 billion per year in R&D, giving our teams the freedom, support and resources
to experiment, test and push the boundaries of technology. They work in close-knit, multidisciplinary
teams, learning and growing along with the company.
