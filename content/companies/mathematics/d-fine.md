d-fine is a European consulting company with over 1,500 employees and a growing international presence with eleven offices distributed across seven countries. Our projects focus on quantitative challenges in data analytics, data science, modelling, and the development of sustainable technological solutions. Our approach is based on over 20 years of practical experience and dynamic teams with an analytical and technological focus.

Our tasks, projects, clients and working models are diverse. We work as a team on-site at the customer, together at one of our offices or remotely in virtual project rooms.

To expand our Consulting & Solutions teams, we are looking for students of physics, mathematics, computer science or natural sciences, engineering and economics with quantitative or technological specializations. You must have a very good academic record, be fluent in Dutch and English and have a high mathematical and/or technological affinity. In addition to strong analytical skills and a results-oriented approach, we attach great importance to social competence. Collaboration and cooperation are part of our company philosophy and is reflected in our work structures, employee development and incentive schemes.

Joining d-fine is possible throughout the whole year at the beginning of each month. After our intensive onboarding program, which lasts several weeks, you will join a (project) team working for our customers.

Our aim is that you feel at home with us and are motivated for the long term. That is why we offer you, in addition to exciting tasks and projects, a collegial team, attractive career and salary model, as well as a wide range of additional benefits, such as our extensive training program as part of the d-fine Academy.
