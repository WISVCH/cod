# About KPMG

#### Who we are
KPMG Netherlands is part of a global network of professional firms providing Audit, Tax and Advisory
services. With over 3,500 employees in the Netherlands in 12 offices, we contribute to progress that
benefits people and society.
#### What we do
We help our clients achieve the growth and/or progress they aim for. Combining the latest
technologies with what we have built up in the past century at KPMG: a foundation of knowledge,
expertise and independent thought. Everything we do is based on the KPMG
values: Integrity, Excellence, Courage, Together and For Better.
#### Culture
You will encounter an open and informal culture. A stimulating mix of entrepreneurship, creativity
and team spirit. You can be yourself, feel appreciated and know that you can make a difference. At
KPMG you are given a lot of responsibility early on and the freedom to develop yourself. Both
professionally and personally. You will grow rapidly thanks to the diversity of engagements and the
innovations you are involved with.
#### Inclusion & Diversity
We strive for a working environment where everyone feels involved and valued, and where there is
room for all employees, regardless of origin, age, gender or disability. A diverse and inclusive culture
leads to more trust, more growth and helps us stand up for what is right. 
#### Corporate Responsibility
We have a high responsibility towards society. We believe it is important to give something back to
society and focus on corporate responsibility. Every day we work towards a sustainable and fair
world. Whether it concerns complex issues within our monitoring and consultancy work, thinking
about a new mobility policy or stimulating innovation within education.
