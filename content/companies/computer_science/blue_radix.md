Ready to solve major global challenges with algorithms?

Blue Radix creates automated intelligence for daily decisions in the greenhouse industry. With the continuous growth of the world population, the need for healthy food is increasing. The greenhouse horticulture business is currently scaling up on a global level. But this scale up cannot be achieved due to a lack of crop experts. At the same time, energy management is increasing in complexity. We have a solution for these worldwide challenges: our algorithm-based solutions offer growers a digital brain for their greenhouse. We believe that algorithms actually can feed the world.

When you work at Blue Radix, you are part of a very committed, skilled and international team of about 30 colleagues with expertise in data science, data engineering, crop consultancy and marketing. We are growing rapidly and are controlling greenhouses spanning hundreds of hectares in 17 countries on 5 continents. Are you eager to help us achieve this great ambition? That’s great! Don’t hesitate – get in touch!
