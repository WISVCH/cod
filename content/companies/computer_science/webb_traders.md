### WE ARE A LEADING MARKET MAKER.
WEBB Traders is a proprietary trading company aiming to redefine trading as a unified effort powered by a broader range of expertise and technology. Since our first trade in 2009, we’ve developed a culture of openness, community, joy, and boundless entrepreneurship.

### WEBB TALENT.
A career at WEBB is more than a job: it's being part of a dedicated community of bright and curious individuals who rise to challenges and strive for excellence. Think trading is all work and no play? Not a chance! We have weekly get-togethers, team events, and yearly trips. WEBB is always growing and expanding into new markets. To keep up with this growth we are on the lookout for talented traders, researchers, engineers, and other experts to join the WEBB movement.

### NOT YOUR TYPICAL TRADING ENVIRONMENT.
To say opportunity is everything is only acknowledging half the story. There’s no one way to trade, and we constantly collaborate across teams and disciplines to unlock new ways to achieve. WEBB leads by empowering people to draw from disciplines outside their expertise to more ingeniously make markets.

### SERVING A GLOBAL FINANCIAL SYSTEM.
We act as a market maker and we use our own capital to trade on global stock and derivatives exchanges. By leveraging a large network of interdealer brokers and the latest advancements in electronic trading technology, we add liquidity to the financial markets by means of skillfully structured trades. We strive to always improve so it is our great ambition to grow WEBB into a global leader in arbitrage and liquidity. We have offices in Amsterdam, Paris, and London and are regulated by the AFM and FCA.

**So if you are driven, a team-player, you love a good challenge and you want the opportunity to learn (a lot!) then we welcome you to apply for one of our openings.**
