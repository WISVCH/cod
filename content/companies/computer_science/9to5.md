9to5 software, located in the heart of Delft, is a dynamic and innovative player in the software industry. Founded in 2012 by two ambitious TU Delft alumni, Tom and Susan, our company is built on a foundation of passion for technology and the drive to revolutionize the software world. From our humble beginnings in an attic office to our current modern workspace at Nieuwelaan 72, we have evolved into a leading organization known for its quality, innovation, and user-centric service.

At 9to5 software, our focus is on creating intelligent, user-centric software solutions that enrich daily life. Our projects range from mobile games like ['nummi'](https://www.9to5.software/en/showcases/nummi), which not only provides entertainment but has also fostered social connections, to [NL-Alarm](https://www.9to5.software/en/showcases/nlalarm), an app that prioritizes privacy and informs the Dutch inhabitants in a personalized way about important alerts.

We take pride in our ability to be at the forefront of applying advanced technologies, such as our AI-driven [Kieswaizer](https://www.9to5.software/en/showcases/kieswaizer) app, which revolutionizes user interaction with political information. Our team specializes in front-end and back-end development, UX/UI design, and mobile app development, using the latest technologies and platforms to bring our projects to life.

For Computer Science students at TU Delft, 9to5 software offers a unique opportunity to be part of a team that values craftsmanship, teamwork, autonomy, and continuous learning. With us, you have the chance to work in an environment that promotes innovation and efficiency, without the burden of bureaucracy often found in large companies.

We are looking for TU Delft students who, like us, believe in the power of technology to bring about positive change and who want to contribute to developing solutions that truly make a difference. If you resonate with our mission and want to work in a friendly, supportive environment, we warmly invite you to come and meet us!
