Vattenfall is a European energy company with approximately 20,000 employees. It is one of Europe’s largest producers and retailers of electricity and heat. For more than 100 years we have electrified industries, supplied energy to people's homes and modernised our way of living through innovation and cooperation. Together with our partners, we are taking on the responsibility to find new and sustainable ways to electrify transportation, industries and heating.
 
At Vattenfall our purpose is to power climate smarter living. We exist to help all our customers power their lives in ever climate smarter ways. We believe the solution is energy that’s free from fossil fuel, so we have committed to an ambitious goal, fossil freedom: a future where everyone can choose fossil free ways to move, make and live. To succeed we must become fossil free ourselves. But that's not enough. We are looking beyond our own industry to see where we can really make a difference, and we are openly inviting everyone to join us throughout this journey.
