At Adyen, we started with payments. Ambition demanded more. So we set off to build a financial technology platform for the modern era, entirely in-house, from the ground up. 

Today, we provide leading businesses around the world with end-to-end payment capabilities, data enhancements, and financial products in a single solution, connecting directly to Visa, Mastercard, and consumers' globally preferred payment methods. With offices around the world, Adyen serves nine of the 10 largest U.S. internet companies and many worldwide retailers. It takes a team of many experts, from all types of backgrounds, to keep Adyen pushing forward. This diversity, of backgrounds, cultures, and perspectives, is essential in helping us maintain our momentum.

#### What we are looking for

Our success depends on qualities outlined in the Adyen Formula - such as valuing teamwork over ego, the ability to communicate effectively and directly, and not stopping until things work. Formula fit is our primary selection criteria.

In addition, we are interested in your educational background, or work portfolio. A degree in a technical field is an enormous asset, although we believe a diversity of skills, viewpoints, and backgrounds makes us stronger. Weâ€™re very interested to hear about the things you are proud of and interested in, and discuss how that may take you further.

We are on the lookout for talented, dedicated engineers, financial experts and data analysts / individuals who not only enjoy assisting clients even with small issues, but are always thinking of creative ways to eliminate the root cause of issues and deliver the smoothest possible experience to the customer.
