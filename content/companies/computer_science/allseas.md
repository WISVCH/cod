Allseas, with its central engineering and project management office in Delft, is a world-leading contractor in the offshore energy market. Experts in the design and execution of large and complex offshore projects, we are constantly pushing the boundaries of technology. Designed and optimised in-house, our versatile fleet of specialised vessels operate worldwide, equipped with the most advanced equipment and systems.

We specialise in the construction of subsea pipelines and structures for the transport of oil and gas. Worldwide we have installed more than 26,000 km of pipeline in water depths up to 3.5 km.

Our flagship vessel Pioneering Spirit  is the largest construction vessel in the world capable of installing and removing entire platform topsides up to 48,000 t and supporting jackets up to 20,000 t in a single-lift. This significantly reduces the amount of offshore work, moving it onshore where it is safer and poses less risk to the environment.

We are developing cutting-edge technology to collect mineral-rich polymetallic nodules from the deep-ocean floor and transfer them to the surface for transport to land. These nodules contain metals needed for batteries in electric vehicles and vessels, and for renewable energy technologies.

Working every day at sea, we witness firsthand the impact plastic pollution has on the oceans and marine life. We contribute to preventing pollution by developing systems that catch waste in rivers before it flows into the sea.

Our people are passionate about their work, and get the freedom to apply their knowledge to develop tomorrowâ€™s technology today. We go beyond existing applications and take the impossible as our starting point. By following this path, we transform bold ideas into state-of-the-art solutions and remain a frontrunner in the market.
